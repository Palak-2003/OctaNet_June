# To-Do-web-App

This repository contains a simple and intuitive To-Do web app developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The app provides essential task management functionalities, allowing users to add, delete, and edit tasks effortlessly. It also includes additional features such as a "Finished" button to mark tasks as completed and a "Get Pending Tasks" button that filters and displays only the pending tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your to-do list. Enter a task description and click the "Add" button to append it to the list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from your list with a single click. Each task item is accompanied by a "Delete" button, which, when clicked, removes the corresponding task from the list.

- **Finished Button:** Mark tasks as completed by clicking the "Finished" button associated with each task. When a task is marked as finished, it moves to the end of the list, providing a visual indication of its completion status.
- **Get Pending Tasks:** Filter and display only the pending tasks by clicking the "Get Pending Tasks" button. This feature helps you focus on the remaining tasks that require your attention.
